Plant Tracking Mobile Appliation
********************************************************************************
- As part of my mobile development class, I had the privilege of gaining an in-depth understanding of the versatile and powerful Flutter framework. This expertise, coupled with the collaboration of three talented classmates, enabled us to create a technically advanced mobile application with a primary focus on plant care.
- Through extensive research on plant longevity, overwatering, sunlight requirements, soil types, and other factors, we identified a significant opportunity for improvement in this domain. Motivated by this, we embarked on creating a mobile application to address these challenges effectively.
